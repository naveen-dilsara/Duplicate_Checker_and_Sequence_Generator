# Duplicate_Checker_and_Sequence_Generator ( C language)


2nd Year, 2nd Semester: Module - Foundation of Algorithms

Develop C or Java source codes for the following applications.


<h3>Question 1 </h3>


You are given a string S containing only lowercase letters and an integer K. In one operation you 
can change any character of the string to '#' character.
Note: '#' is not considered when checking for duplicates.
Print the minimum number of operations required such that no substring of size K contains 
duplicates.

Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.
The second line contains the value of K.

Output Format:
The minimum number of operations required such that no substring of size K contains duplicates

Ex:
Sample Input  |   Sample Output
--------------|-----------------
ababc         |    2



<h3>Question 2 </h3>


You are given two non-decreasing sequences A=(a1,a2,...,an) and B=(b1,b2,...,bm).
You can choose any two indices i and j, and then swap ai and bj.
Note that you can do the operations as many times as you want, and your goal is to transform A into 
an arithmetic sequence. After operations, you can rearrange the sequence A.
Determine how many distinct arithmetic sequences you can obtain.

Input Format:
First line contains 2 numbers (the length of A and B)
Second line contains array A.
Third line contains array B.

Output Format:
Print the number of distinct arithmetic sequences.

Ex:
Sample Input    |     Sample Output
----------------|-------------------
3   3           |
-1 0 2          |      4
0 1 2           |
